**Healthcare Coding Skills Workshop Materials**

These files are for a 2-hour introductory coding skills workshop, developed for healthcare students at The University of Manchester. 

The workshop includes hands-on activities with Python (through JupyterLab notebook) and HTML.

Python hands-on files include two versions: "tasks only" and "with exemplar answers"

Associated PPTX slide deck for teaching can be obtained from Dr Daniel Scotcher (daniel.scotcher@manchester.ac.uk)
